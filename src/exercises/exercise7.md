# Exercise 7

Add the following dependency to the `pom.xml` file
```javascript
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
    </dependency>
```
- What is the purpose of this dependency?
  - Read about it in the paragraph `Automatic Restart` on https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/using/devtools.html
- Try it out by adding some extra code in your project such as adding a new simple validation rule: "The title of a course should not be empty".
